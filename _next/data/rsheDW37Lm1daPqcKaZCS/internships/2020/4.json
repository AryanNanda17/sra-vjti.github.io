Airpix.io is an analytics platform that provides services in face recognition, video analytics, optical character recognition by Leveraging AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning technologies. AIsyte is the product that provides these analytics services.My position in internship was ‘AI ML and Edge Computing Intern’. The tasks were related to developing applications for Traffic monitoring, Face recognition, Pose estimation, etc. The position required knowledge in Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, etc. It started with a 3 months unpaid internship. After that, I was offered a paid internship . I worked under the guidance of Aniket Tatipamula Sir."},{"type":"subtitle","content":"2) How do you approach the Organization/University ?"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The application form was sent by my college.

I was part of the group -Bank Safety. Initially the tasks involved collecting and annotating large datasets for custom object detection such as helmets, guns. In the initial few weeks we were made familiar with different detectors such as YOLO, SSD and their implementations on pytorch and darknet. After the custom detection part that main job revolved around detecting suspicious activities which was done using pose detectors along with LSTM to get accurate results.The second half of the internship dealt with working on the traffic monitoring framework which was developed earlier by a team. This module was to be integrated along with the web app as well, so for this the earlier code was to be cleaned and separated into different modules and later multiprocessing was implemented to run different analytics separately. After this, a major task revolved around deploying this application on Nvidia edge (jetson) devices and obtaining optimised and efficient results with better performance. My further work on this project is underway."},{"type":"subtitle","content":"4) How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Remote internship due to pandemic, N/A"},{"type":"subtitle","content":"5) How much was your stipend ?"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Confidential"},{"type":"subtitle","content":"6) Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Confidential"},{"type":"subtitle","content":"7) Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This internship has some basic technical prerequisites along with the will to work efficiently and with dedication.
