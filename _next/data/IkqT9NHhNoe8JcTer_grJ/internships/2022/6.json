As cool as this may sound, it was a poor experience as it was about writing an algorithm to optimize memory for static budgets. I never did any DSA, and it got me hard. I messed this up with a mediocre algorithm that did a 20% reduction in run time memory usage by destroying the parallel nature of CUDA streams. Just something so that they won’t outcast me.\nThe mentor’s name was Danny Periera and the prof was Dr. Soumyajit Dey.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nI applied through the IIT-KGP website, which redirected the applicants to a Google Form link.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nRead my boring report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JwEKxROY032WaSQX4hATHqtf75X_2jV3/view?usp=sharing).\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nI did a remote internship because they couldn’t provide me with accommodations on campus.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nINR 14000 in total. They declined me an LoR and stated that it needs students to work for at least 8-9 months.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nRead my boring report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JwEKxROY032WaSQX4hATHqtf75X_2jV3/view?usp=sharing). The github repository is private until I am instructed to make it public (forever). Also, they never showed me their code for deriving a static schedule using SMT solvers.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nDon’t apply for internships in Indian institutes in any systems related field unless you can see their commits on github and you can assess the quality of their work.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - shreyasatre16@gmail.com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
