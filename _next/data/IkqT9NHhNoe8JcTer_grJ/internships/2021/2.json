Long story short, there were no novel inputs from me, and the professor wasn’t helpful in any way. I just re implemented the examples, and we called it done.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nI did a remote internship because it was COVID-19.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nNothing\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nCheck out the examples from SNAP and DGL; I just copied and pasted those shamelessly.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nDon’t take suggestions from professors on topics neither of you are familiar with. Also clarify whether they are going to provide you with an LOR before starting anything.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - shreyasatre16@gmail.com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
